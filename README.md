## üéØ Project Overview

This CAD project delivers a full mechanical model of a quadcopter including structural components and a camera mount setup. The design is intended for student projects and prototyping, enabling customization for frames, motors, and sensors.

Key features:
- Modular frame design for easy parts replacement.
- Integrated camera mount for aerial photography/video.
- Manufacturing-ready drawing for the full assembly.
- Designed in SolidWorks for ease of editing and simulation.

## üõ† How to Use

1. Open the SolidWorks files in the version you have (preferably 2019 or later).  
2. Review the `Drone Assembly.SLDASM` to see how parts come together.  
3. Modify individual part files (e.g., change motor size, propeller size) as needed.  
4. Use the drawing (`.SLDDRW` / PDF) for manufacturing or reference.  
5. Export parts for printing/machining as required.

## üîß Design Considerations

- **Frame stack-up**: The bottom base plates and upper cover are designed for rigidity and minimal weight.  
- **Propulsion**: Standard brushless DC motor models and propellers are included.  
- **Camera integration**: A mount is provided to accommodate standard action cameras (e.g., GoPro-style).  
- **Landing gear**: Simple but effective landing base for stability on takeoff/landing.
